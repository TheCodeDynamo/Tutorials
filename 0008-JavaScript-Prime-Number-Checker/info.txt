A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has exactly two distinct 
positive divisors: 1 and itself. 
In other words, a prime number cannot be evenly divided by any other natural number 
except for 1 and the number itself.

Here are a few examples of prime numbers:

2 (because it has only two divisors: 1 and 2)
3 (because it has only two divisors: 1 and 3)
5 (because it has only two divisors: 1 and 5)
7 (because it has only two divisors: 1 and 7)
11 (because it has only two divisors: 1 and 11)

Prime numbers play a fundamental role in number theory 
and various areas of mathematics and computer science. 
They are important in cryptography, for example, where their properties are 
used to secure information.
